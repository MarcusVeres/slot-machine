Proof of concept for Doritos randomizer ad unit.

### To be discussed:
We can include the recipe data (json format) inside the ad unit, or pull it from an external source.  
If we choose to import the data, we would be able to update recipes on the fly, and potentially keep the ad unit relevant into the future.  
However, this approach would require well-configured CORS, and might fail if the data source is down.
